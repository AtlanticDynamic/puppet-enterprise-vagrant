# Puppet Enterprise and Vagrant setup

This Vagrant file will create two virtual machines, useful for development of
Puppet code on Puppet Enterprise. This code is a simple alternative to [Adrien's](https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-pe_build), because it provides a complete multi-box Vagrant file, and
an example of how to support multiple Vagrant provisioner types (both 
Virtualbox and VMWare) with a single Vagrant file.
